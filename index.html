                        <p>Abby really likes having Kassie home more thanks to BCIT online classes, but she doesn't like it when Kassie gets too focused on her coding... Abby has decided that she won't let Kassie code in peace until she gets enough play time.  She has stolen Kassie's slipper and demands some play time.</p>

                        <p>After running off with the slipper, Abby is picking up speed... She's very hard to catch!  In order for her to be fully satisfied with her play time, she must be caught at least 20 times within the time limit of the game.  If you fail to catch her enough times, then you must try to play with her again until you make her happy enough to relax & let Kassie code in peace! Please succeed, Kassie's grades depend on it!</p>
